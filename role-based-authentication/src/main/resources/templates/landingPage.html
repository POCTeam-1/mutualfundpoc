				A mutual fund is an investment fund that pools money from many investors to purchase securities.
				A mutual fund is a pool of money managed by a professional Fund Manager. <br> <br> It is a trust that
				collects money from a number of investors who share a common investment objective and invests the same
				in
				equities, bonds, money market instruments and/or other securities. And the income / gains generated from
				this collective investment is distributed proportionately amongst the investors after deducting
				applicable
				expenses and levies, by calculating a scheme's “Net Asset Value” or NAV. Simply put, the money pooled in
				by a large number of investors is what makes up a Mutual Fund. <br> <br> Mutual funds are ideal for
				investors who either lack large sums for investment, or for those who neither have the inclination nor
				the time to research the market, yet want to grow their wealth. The money collected in mutual funds is
				invested by professional fund managers in line with the scheme’s stated objective. In return, the fund
				house charges a small fee which is deducted from the investment. The fees charged by mutual funds are
				regulated and are subject to certain limits specified by the Securities and Exchange Board of India
				(SEBI).

			<p>Types of mutual funds </p>

			<p>
				What are Equity Mutual Funds? <br> <br> As the name suggests, Equity Funds invest in the shares of
				different companies. The fund manager tries to offer great returns by spreading his investment across
				companies from different sectors or with varying market capitalizations. Typically, these funds are
				known to generate better returns than term deposits or debt-based funds. There is an amount of risk
				associated with these funds since their performance depends on various market conditions.
			</p>
			<p>
				What is a Debt Fund? <br> <br> Debt funds invest in securities which generate fixed income like
				treasury bills, corporate bonds, commercial papers, government securities, and many other money market
				instruments. All these instruments have a pre-decided maturity date and interest rate that the buyer
				can earn on maturity - hence the name fixed-income securities. The returns are usually not affected by
				fluctuations in the market. Therefore, debt securities are considered to be low-risk investment options.
			</p>
			<p>
				What are Hybrid Mutual Funds? <br> <br> To simplify hybrid fund meaning, it can be said that hybrid
				funds are a combination of equity and debt investments which are designed to meet the investment
				objective of the scheme. Each hybrid fund has a different combination of equity and debt targeted at
				different types of investors.
